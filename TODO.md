# "" page

When navigating to /dashboard, a user should see a list of bots, both theirs and other users'.

- A card for each of their bots, with:
  - a link for creating a new chat and one that would expand a list of all the chats with that bot.
  - The name and avatar of the user who created the bot.
- A filtering interface should be provided, so that the user can filter by:
  - author
  - bot's username
  - emulee's username
- a form to create a new one.

This page, together with the chat, should be included in a new layout.

The layout will have: a sidebar / burger menu with all the past chats and a link to the developers page + a button to create a new one.
