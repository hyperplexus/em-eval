# Todo

## Auth

[x] Error handling: Add error handling in the signIn callback to handle any errors that might occur when creating the ApiUser or generating the API key.
[x] User feedback: Provide feedback to the user if they are not allowed to sign in or if there was an error during the sign-in process.
[x] Security: Ensure that the API key is securely stored and transmitted. Consider using HTTPS and storing the key in a secure, encrypted format.
[] Testing: Add tests to ensure that the authentication process works as expected. This could include unit tests for the signIn and jwt callbacks, and end-to-end tests for the entire authentication flow.
